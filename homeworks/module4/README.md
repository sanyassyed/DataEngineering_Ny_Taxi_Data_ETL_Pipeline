# Module 4 Homework: Analytics Engineering with dbt

In this homework, we'll use the dbt project in `04-analytics-engineering/taxi_rides_ny/` to transform NYC taxi data and answer questions by querying the models.

## Setup

1. Set up your dbt project following the [setup guide](../../../04-analytics-engineering/setup/)
2. Load the Green and Yellow taxi data for 2019-2020 into your warehouse
3. Run `dbt build --target prod` to create all models and run tests

> **Note:** By default, dbt uses the `dev` target. You must use `--target prod` to build the models in the production dataset, which is required for the homework queries below.

After a successful build, you should have models like `fct_trips`, `dim_zones`, and `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` in your warehouse.

### Question 1. dbt Lineage and Execution

Given a dbt project with the following structure:

```
models/
├── staging/
│   ├── stg_green_tripdata.sql
│   └── stg_yellow_tripdata.sql
└── intermediate/
    └── int_trips_unioned.sql (depends on stg_green_tripdata & stg_yellow_tripdata)
```

If you run `dbt run --select int_trips_unioned`, what models will be built?

- `int_trips_unioned` only


---

### Question 2. dbt Tests

You've configured a generic test like this in your `schema.yml`:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: payment_type
    data_tests:
      - accepted_values:
          arguments:
            values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            quote: false
```

Your model `fct_trips` has been running successfully for months. A new value `6` now appears in the source data.

What happens when you run `dbt test --select fct_trips`?


- dbt will fail the test, returning a non-zero exit code


---

### Question 3. Counting Records in `fct_monthly_zone_revenue`

After running your dbt project, query the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` model.

What is the count of records in the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` model?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM prod.fct_monthly_zone_revenue;
```
- 12,184


---

### Question 4. Best Performing Zone for Green Taxis (2020)

Using the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` table, find the pickup zone with the **highest total revenue** (`revenue_monthly_total_amount`) for **Green** taxi trips in 2020.

Which zone had the highest revenue?
```sql
SELECT pickup_zone,
       SUM(revenue_monthly_total_amount) total
FROM prod.fct_monthly_zone_revenue
WHERE service_type = 'Green' AND
      YEAR(revenue_month) = 2020
GROUP BY pickup_zone
ORDER BY SUM(revenue_monthly_total_amount) DESC;
```
- East Harlem North


---

### Question 5. Green Taxi Trip Counts (October 2019)

Using the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` table, what is the **total number of trips** (`total_monthly_trips`) for Green taxis in October 2019?

```sql
SELECT SUM(total_monthly_trips) total_trips
FROM prod.fct_monthly_zone_revenue
WHERE trim(lower(service_type)) = 'green' AND
YEAR(revenue_month) = 2019 AND
MONTH(revenue_month) = 10;
```
- 384,624


---

### Question 6. Build a Staging Model for FHV Data

Create a staging model for the **For-Hire Vehicle (FHV)** trip data for 2019.

1. Load the [FHV trip data for 2019](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/tag/fhv) into your data warehouse
2. Create a staging model `stg_fhv_tripdata` with these requirements:
   - Filter out records where `dispatching_base_num IS NULL`
   - Rename fields to match your project's naming conventions (e.g., `PUlocationID` → `pickup_location_id`)

What is the count of records in `stg_fhv_tripdata`?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM prod.stg_fhv_tripdata WHERE YEAR(pickup_datetime) = 2019;
```
